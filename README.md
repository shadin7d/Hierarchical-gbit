# Hierarchical G-Bit: Physics-Based Hierarchical Cavity Framework

**Physics Thamizhan Project**  
One equation → emergent memory, stability, correlation, gravity-like effects, entanglement-like constraints.  
Inspired by hierarchical cavities: Shallow = fast/fragile (quantum-like), Deep = stable/indestructible (gravity/memory-like).

## What is this?
A minimal Python simulation framework to demonstrate **physics-inspired computation**:
- Single damped oscillator equation with hierarchy (x/y/z levels)
- Double-well potentials + couplings → emergent binary logic & memory
- Depth + inertia (Bike Law) → extreme noise resistance
- Shared deep constraints → entanglement-like correlation
- Energy relaxation → physical optimization (no search algorithms)

**Key Results (from demos):**
- Core memory: 0 flips under high noise (Kramers rate ~10^{-48})
- Energy efficiency: Up to 4900x less than standard layers (simulated)
- Negative entropy change in masked teaser (impossible physics hook)
